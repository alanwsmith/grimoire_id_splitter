Grimoire ID Splitter

This is a process to split up my Grimoire IDs
from 8 characters to four sets of 2 characters
divided by ``/`` characters. The ids are used
to generate folders for files in Neopoligen. 
Doing this split means no more that around
1000 folders end up an any given part of the
tree. 

I'm making this move because the more files
and folders you have in a directory 
the more it can slow certain processes 
(like listing files). I've already got
2,700 pages on the site and that number
will go up significantly when I start splitting
out quotes and bookmarks to their own
pages. 

-- notes

- This will add a new line to the end of the file
if the id is the last thing in the file that doesn't
currently have a new line. I could change that, but
it's not worth the effort.
